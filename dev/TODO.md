# Vintage Horizons — TODO and verification debt

> Tier 2 companion: open work only. Completed narrative moves to `dev/history/DONE.md`; current conclusions belong in `STATUS.md`.

## Top priority — main-thread stutter and renderer scaling

The approved implementation sequence is `dev/plans/PLAN_MAIN_THREAD_PERFORMANCE.md`.

### Documentation and baseline

- Repeat the recorded hardware/settings/config benchmark on the eventual release candidate if its code or sandbox state differs materially.

### Renderer scaling

- Human-check clipping and turn-around behavior on the thousands-section build. Automated
  scaling now covers 3,132 persisted sections; the controlled 601-section pair remains the
  causal traversal comparison.
- Measure whether regional buffers or multi-draw are warranted after CPU fixes.
- Select a practical default far cap only from benchmark and playtest evidence.

## Flagged decisions awaiting human evidence

- What default far-distance cap, if any, gives the best product experience after the renderer fixes?
- Is temporary coarseness acceptable while time-budgeted installs catch up during fast travel?
- Does visual quality permit more aggressive off-screen GPU eviction without noticeable turn-around stalls?

## Verification debt

- Two one-way 1,600-block capture-frontier runs started with zero active VH databases and
  `0 sections from cache`. Both had zero VH ticks at or above 25 ms; capture backlog stayed
  within 20 results / 1.61 MiB / 234 ms and converged during the endpoint cooldown. The
  first run generated server-save terrain and the second reused it, so aggregate FPS is
  not controlled A/B evidence. No person watched the cold route in motion.
- Asynchronous mip propagation now has a 120-second movement/capture convergence soak,
  graceful restart, deliberate interruption after a durable `ApplyToParent` write,
  successful recovery of one persisted obligation, and a third fresh process reporting
  zero obligations. Both dedicated client/server and integrated-singleplayer durability
  are established for the guarded routes.
- The complete game-backed fast tier passes 1,056 assertions across 25 suites. A real game process still supplies the only end-to-end proof of thread ownership and GPU behavior.
- Live server-assist transfer exercises network request state end to end. An integrated
  command-generation run discovered 211 sibling keys, forced one retryable miss, and
  installed that exact key plus 62 others. Natural miss frequency and default-sweep
  sibling-cache behavior remain unmeasured.
- Cached bounds and projection hysteresis pass 30 isolated assertions. The corrected long
  warm-cache route completed with five projection resets and no tick hitches, and human
  review found motion smooth with no noticed clipping. The earlier route screenshots were
  sky-biased; cold terrain/coverage arrival still needs visual review.
- Visibility-aware traversal passes source/harness checks and a controlled same-cache
  601-section route: selected nodes fell 64.2%, average traversal 19.8%, and average draw
  submission 9.3%, while both sides retained 543 meshes with zero evictions. A later
  3,132-section automated route bounded renderer queues and converged, but aggregate FPS
  is not a controlled comparison and human motion review remains.
- Incremental render-dirty scheduling passes 20 focused assertions and a functional
  601-section moving/rotation route that settled every waypoint and converged all guarded
  queues. A later 3,132-section route supplied functional scaling evidence, but there is
  no controlled old/new scheduler comparison or human review of this build.
- Mesh snapshot/upload budgets pass deterministic accounting/progress checks and a
  zero-warning Release build. A 12,800-block cache-growth route processed 94,285
  snapshots/uploads, bounded sampled queues to 18/four items, measured direct GL upload
  below 6.9 ms, recorded no 25 ms renderer phase, and converged. No person watched visual
  replacement behavior and no second driver has been measured.
- Revisioned persistence passes injected failure/retry, repeated mutation, pending
  coalescing, 300-key drain, and newest-row restart checks. A 3,132-section runtime route
  reopened the cache, wrote 138 revisions, and ended with zero unsaved/backlog/errors.
  Persistent-failure timeout reporting has source/check evidence but has not been forced
  inside a game process.
- Capture publication is source-bounded and passed a warm-cache same-route before/after
  run: its maximum fell from 12.038 to 5.732 ms and backlog peaked at 9 results / 0.70 MiB /
  93 ms. One admitted result remains non-preemptible; unseen terrain and interrupted
  shutdown were not exercised.
- A warm-cache join adopted 558 sections with an 11.180 ms worst Vintage Horizons tick
  and no 25 ms hitch. Background-load backlog reached 181 sections / 51.93 MiB / 11.531 s
  old and drained by 30 seconds. This is one client-only warm sample, not a cold/warm A/B
  comparison. Integrated recovery/postcheck processes later loaded 168 sections and
  converged, but they were correctness routes rather than join-performance evidence.
- A pinned dedicated-server sweep examined 3,249 dependency-aware positions, loaded 1,018
  existing columns, skipped 377 frontier columns, generated nothing, and verified 256/256
  sampled absent positions. Server pipeline ticks peaked at 17.874 ms with no 25 ms hitch;
  probe/load issue maxima were 3.945/6.004 ms. The server cache was warm, and
  savegame-sweep cadence remains unprofiled in integrated singleplayer.
- Completed transient generation produced 289/289 columns with zero timeouts or unusable
  height maps and preserved 256/256 sampled absences. This is one radius-8 dedicated-server
  absence-preservation run. A radius-12 integrated run separately generated 414 columns
  with no timeout/height-map failure and fed live sibling adoption, but all absence samples
  were excluded near the player; neither is a long/default-radius soak.
- The repeated 64/s saturated-assist run again requested, received, and installed 395
  sections with zero declines. One 17.481 ms background read coincided with a 0.989 ms
  owning-thread assist maximum, proving separation. A later interval had a 32.450 ms
  assist outlier while reader calls stayed below 0.2 ms, so packet publication, GC, or
  process scheduling remains a distinct tail to isolate. No person watched the route.
- Two warmed steady-stationary on/off pairs measured about 0.7% lower average FPS and
  1.0% lower median FPS with allocation telemetry at roughly 445 uncapped FPS. Their 1%
  lows reversed direction, and ordinary capped-frame-rate overhead remains unmeasured.
- GPU bottleneck attribution remains unmeasured; CPU/render-thread findings must not be presented as proof that the shader or GPU is innocent.
