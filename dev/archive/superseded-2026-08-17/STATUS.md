# M4/M5 status notes

## Performance pass (2026-07-24)

Three changes, each measured rather than assumed:

- **Frustum culling.** The quadtree walk selects in every direction, so sections
  behind the camera were still issuing draw calls. Planes are extracted from the
  same projection*view matrices the LOD shader gets, and tested at DRAW time only
  - culling inside the selection walk would evict off-screen meshes and re-mesh
  them the instant you turned around. Cull share runs 12%->59% depending on how
  much captured data surrounds the camera. Plane math is covered by the frustum
  suite in `scripts/check.sh fast` (behind/left/right/above/beyond-far reject;
  in-view cases pass; matrices built with the game's own `Mat4f` so the extraction's
  column-major assumption is tested rather than assumed).
- **Writes off the render thread.** Save batches measured 10-22ms average and
  49ms peak on the main thread - a whole 50ms tick - because serializing deflates
  ~100-300KB inline. Sections are frozen on the main thread (copies: the live
  section keeps mutating and SetColumn edits Runs in place) and compressed +
  written by a storage thread, with deflate outside the DB lock. After: 0.3ms
  average, ~3ms peak on an equivalent batch (~32x).
- **Reads off the render thread.** 302 inline loads at join (4.3ms avg, 29.5ms
  peak) -> 47, with 600 served in the background. Capture and mip propagation
  stay synchronous on purpose: they must merge into stored data before creating a
  section, which is exactly how stored rows got shadowed and overwritten before.

Two hazards found and closed while doing it: the storage thread must not touch
the block registry (the sibling `GetBlock(int)` lazily mutates a dictionary), so
off-thread loads keep palette CODES and resolve ids at install on the main
thread; and a reload that comes back empty is remembered, or the walk
re-requests that key every frame forever.

Verification beyond the counters: restart reloaded 958 sections with zero
unreadable rows, and decompressing freshly written blobs showed 0 empty block
codes across L0/L1/L2 (a failed id resolution would have written empty codes).

Remaining known costs: 47 inline loads per join from the capture/propagation
paths (8ms avg, 33ms peak) - making propagation defer safely is the next step.

## Multiplayer verified (2026-07-16 evening)

The headline claim - client-side-only install working on an unmodded server -
is now tested: a strictly vanilla dedicated server (`scripts/test-server.sh`,
fresh dataPath, zero mods) with the release zip as the client's only mod.
Full pipeline flowed from server-streamed chunks: 3,183 columns captured,
311 sections across all 7 levels, meshing/draw/persistence all live, fresh
per-world cache db keyed by SavegameIdentifier (works in MP), 343 sections
persisted. Capture errors accumulate faster in MP than SP (50 in ~5 min,
suspected chunk-disposed-mid-read after teleport hops); worker now records
the first swallowed exception and logs it with the next stats line.

### Test isolation (hard rules - a violation crashed the user's game once)

- The VS client is single-instance via a global named pipe in `$TMPDIR`
  (`CoreFxPipe_SingleInstanceVintageStoryWithUriScheme`). A `-c host:port`
  launch FORWARDS the connect into any already-running instance (even with
  `--dataPath`!) and exits silently. `scripts/test-client.sh` isolates via a
  sandbox-private TMPDIR.
- Start test instances only via `scripts/test-client.sh` / `test-server.sh`;
  stop them only via `scripts/test-stop.sh` (pidfiles from `$!`). Never
  locate game processes by name/args - the user plays concurrently.
- Sandbox mods go in `.testdata/Mods` and load via `--addModPath` (a relative
  `Mods` entry in clientsettings resolves against the game install dir).

## M5 progress (2026-07-15 morning)

- **VRAM eviction + demand-driven re-meshing** (first M5 item): meshes the quadtree
  hasn't selected for ~60s are disposed; when the walk wants a missing mesh again it
  re-requests it via the render-dirty queue (the selection walk IS the load queue -
  Voxy's idea, CPU-side). No holes: a section only stops being selected when its
  parent renders instead, and re-requested nodes stay covered by the parent until
  their mesh uploads. Remaining M5 items: greedy quad merging, seasonal tint classes
  + snow line, config GUI/persisted settings, RAM-side section eviction, ModDB prep.

# M4 first pass - overnight status (branch `m4-blockdata`, merged to master)

## What this branch does

Replaces the M3 heightmap data model with the real Distant Horizons-style pipeline
(DESIGN.md §4, originally planned for M3 and deferred):

- **Block-data capture**: chunk columns are scanned block-by-block (FluidOrSolid
  layer) from the rain height down to y=1 on a **worker thread**, producing vertical
  RLE runs. Trees, overhangs, caves-from-outside, and player edits are all captured -
  no more worldgen-heightmap limitations.
- **`LodSection`**: 64×64 columns per section, 2-block columns at level 0 (finer than
  M3's 4-block), packed `ulong` runs (`paletteId | yTop | yBottom`) over a per-section
  palette. Palettes store block **codes** on disk (ids are savegame-local).
- **3D meshing** (worker thread): every run is a box - top faces at air gaps, bottom
  faces under overhangs, side walls where the neighbor column's runs don't cover the
  span (interval subtraction), cross-section culling via neighbor snapshots.
  Thread-safety by convention: section run arrays are immutable once created (writes
  swap whole arrays), so worker snapshots are race-free.
- **Mip pyramid**: 2×2 columns merge via y-boundary slice sweep, majority occupancy
  (≥2 of 4), most-common block per slice. Crash-safe ApplyToParent flags as before.
- **Storage v4**: `Section` table, blob = palette (codes+colors+flags) + run-count
  plane + packed runs + captured bitset, deflated. v3 caches are purged on open.
- **Dev auto-unpause**: `VINTAGEHORIZONS_AUTOUNPAUSE=1` keeps singleplayer ticking
  without window focus (renderer-driven, since tick callbacks stall while paused) -
  this is what made unattended overnight verification possible.

## Verified overnight (unattended, real survival world)

- Full pipeline flows without focus: capture → palette remap → apply → mip →
  worker meshing → GL upload. First 30s: 116 columns captured, 24 sections across
  all 6 levels, 15 meshes, zero exceptions, zero GL errors.
- "1 drawn" in early stats is the no-holes swap rule mid-buildup (root renders until
  its subtree is fully meshed), not a bug - per-level draw histograms in later stats
  lines should show the walk descending as meshes complete.
- (See git log on this branch for exact telemetry at each iteration.)

## Verified later in the night

- **v4 persistence round-trip**: 29 sections saved with block-code palettes reloaded
  cleanly on rejoin ("29 sections from cache", zero unreadable rows).
- **Quadtree draw histogram**: once the cached subtree was fully meshed, the walk
  descended to `16 drawn [L0:16]` - full leaf detail near the player. The earlier
  "1 drawn" was the no-holes swap rule during buildup, as suspected.
- **Water pass added** (commit b764052): water meshes into a separate buffer drawn
  alpha-blended (α=168) after the opaque pass, with phase-aware face culling -
  solid faces only culled by solid neighbors so lake/ocean floors render under
  translucent water. NEEDS EYEBALLING in-game.

## Known gaps / follow-ups (deliberate for a first pass)

1. **No greedy quad merging** - vertex counts are box-naive; fine at current scale.
2. **Cross-level seams**: section borders between different detail levels may show
   cracks (M3's skirts were removed with the heightmap mesher; box walls go deep so
   it's less severe - needs eyeballing).
3. **Initial-buildup coarseness**: until a subtree fully meshes, the coarse parent
   renders even close to the player (swap rule). Cosmetic; refine in M5.
4. **Mesh memory**: all levels stay in RAM and VRAM; eviction is M5 territory.
   Baseline RSS during soak: ~3.8GB (game itself is most of it; watch the trend,
   not the absolute).
5. Deep oceans: capture includes full water depth from the rain height - verify
   visuals and mesh sizes over large water bodies.
6. Water draws unsorted within the blended pass (fine for a single surface;
   revisit if stacked water layers show artifacts).

## How to run

```sh
scripts/check.sh                          # the standing regimen, before committing
scripts/check.sh fast                     # pure logic and static assets only (~30s)
scripts/dev-run.sh                        # normal
VINTAGEHORIZONS_AUTOUNPAUSE=1 scripts/dev-run.sh   # unattended testing
```

`.vhinfo` in chat for live stats, `.vhwhy` to explain coarse terrain. Stats also log
every 15s when either `VINTAGEHORIZONS_AUTOUNPAUSE=1` or `VINTAGEHORIZONS_STATS=1` is
set, and once unconditionally 30s after level finalize.
