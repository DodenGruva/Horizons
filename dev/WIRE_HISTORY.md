# Vintage Horizons — compatibility ledger

> Tier 3: append-only history for externally persisted or transmitted meanings. Code constants are current authority; this ledger explains how and why they moved.

## Current compatibility numbers

- **Assist protocol:** `1`
- **Section blob format:** `4`
- **Database schema meaning:** `6`

## Assist protocol ledger

| Protocol | Released | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.2.0 | Optional server handshake, chunked key manifest, batched section request, and one stored section blob or explicit empty refusal per response. |

Current message types:

- `AssistHello`
- `AssistWelcome`
- `AssistKeyManifest`
- `AssistSectionRequest`
- `AssistSection`

Protobuf fields are append-compatible. Bump the protocol when an existing message or field changes meaning, required sequencing changes, or old peers would interpret a valid exchange incorrectly.

## Section blob-format ledger

| Blob format | Current schema | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 6 | Deflated section containing block-code palette entries, untinted colors, material flags, per-column run counts, packed runs, and captured-column bits. Tint slots are resolved live and are not persisted. |

Earlier blob formats existed in the original development history but have not yet been reconstructed from Git. Do not invent their meanings from the current reader; add rows only from source history or preserved release evidence.

## Database schema-meaning ledger

| Schema | Released | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | 0.2.0–0.2.1 | Stored palette colors are untinted and block semantics are reclassified from live registry data. Rows from other schema meanings are purged rather than interpreted. |

The database table layout may remain SQL-compatible while `SchemaVersion` changes because the stored values acquired new semantics. A schema-meaning bump intentionally invalidates existing cache rows.

## Rules for compatibility changes

When changing protocol, blob format, or schema meaning:

1. Decide whether old readers can interpret the new meaning safely.
2. Update the code constant and serialization/deserialization behavior together.
3. Add an append-only ledger row here.
4. Add round-trip, rejection, and mixed-version tests where applicable.
5. Update `STATUS.md` and the session record.
6. Ensure destructive cache invalidation reports what it discarded.
7. Run `dev/DocCheck.ps1` and the fast checks.
